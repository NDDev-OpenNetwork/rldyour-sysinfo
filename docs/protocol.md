# rldyour-sysinfo protocol

The daemon publishes newline-delimited JSON over a per-user local socket.
Every client sees the same stream; every sample carries every field, with
`null` wherever the host cannot supply a reading — a client never has to
distinguish "missing" from "unsupported".

## Transport

| Platform | Socket |
|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rldyour-sysinfo.sock` (normally `/run/user/<uid>/rldyour-sysinfo.sock`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/rldyour-sysinfo/rldyour-sysinfo.sock` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rldyour-sysinfo\rldyour-sysinfo.sock` |

The socket is mode `0600`: only the owning user may connect. On Linux the
socket is normally bound by systemd (`SocketMode=0600`) and on macOS by
launchd (`SockPathMode` 384), so the daemon only binds it itself when run
without a service manager — and applies the same mode either way.

## Handshake

On connect a client may write one line stating the cadence it wants, in
whole seconds:

```json
{"interval":5}
```

- Bounds are 0–60. `0` is not "never": it selects realtime, a 500 ms tick —
  the fastest cadence at which the readers stay meaningful. Anything outside
  the range is ignored.
- The daemon serves the fastest cadence any connected client requested and
  falls back to its configured `RLDYOUR_SYSINFO_INTERVAL` (default 5).
- A client that sends nothing gets the configured cadence — the handshake
  is optional.
- The daemon reads at most one line and waits at most 250 ms for it.

## Sample

One JSON object per tick, terminated by `\n`:

```json
{"v":1,"cpu":{"usage":55.4,"temp":88.6},"memory":{"used":54.7,"swap":4.2},
 "gpu":{"usage":7.0,"memory":9.6,"temp":69.0},
 "disk":{"read":10628,"write":3789480,"temp":47.8},
 "net":{"rx":18360,"tx":342578}}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `v` | int | protocol version |
| `cpu.usage` | float % | busy share of all cores in the interval |
| `cpu.temp` | float °C | package temperature |
| `memory.used` | float % | physical memory in use |
| `memory.swap` | float % | swap in use; `null` when there is no swap |
| `gpu.usage` | float % | GPU busy share in the interval |
| `gpu.memory` | float % | video memory in use |
| `gpu.temp` | float °C | GPU temperature |
| `disk.read` / `disk.write` | int | bytes per second, physical devices |
| `disk.temp` | float °C | storage temperature |
| `net.rx` / `net.tx` | int | bytes per second, physical interfaces |

Rate fields need two samples to exist, so the first tick of a daemon that
cold-started reports them as `null`. Clients should check `v` and ignore a
version they do not implement; new fields may appear inside version 1
without a version bump — only an incompatible change increments it.

## Lifecycle

Linux and macOS use socket activation (systemd user socket, launchd
`Sockets`), so the daemon may exit after thirty seconds without clients and
is respawned by the next connection. Windows has no per-user socket
activation; the daemon starts at login through the Run key and stays
resident. Either way a client that finds no listener should reconnect on a
short backoff rather than treat it as an error.
